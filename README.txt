Experimental generation of an "ID card" for an action (Model conceptualisation)

Flexible semantic annotations of subject, predicate and object on hypothes.is are extracted (saved in hypothesis.rds) and processed to generate a consistent set of triples (out/statements.csv).

Recursive functions are used to display the triples, with information about sub-actions shown as indented text (out/conceptualisation.txt) or html (out/conceptualisation.html), for a specified list of predicates.


A similar ID card generated manually is shown in:
